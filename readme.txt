This Widget shows a single random post from a given category.


== Description ==

There are times when you'd like to have a certain type of post appear in a widget for use in your sidebar (or in some themes) your header.

I use this to display a random Haiku on each page, but it will work equally well for any group of reasonably small posts.

There is the option to include the title of the post or (like I do) not.

If you want you can have up to nine different widgets showing a random post from nine categories.


== Installation ==

Installing is pretty easy takes only a few minutes.

1. Upload 'random-one-cat-widget.php' to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. On the 'widgets' sub-menu of 'Presentation' you will find a new widget type 'Random One Cat'

4. Add one or more of these to your display and select a title and category.  Decide if you'd like to see the post title.  Save your settings.

5. You're done.
