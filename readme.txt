This Widget shows up to five random posts from a given category


== Description ==

There are times when you'd like to have a certain type of post appear in a widget for use in your sidebar or (in some themes) your header or footer.

I use this to display a random senryu on each page, but it will work equally well for any group of reasonably small posts.

There is the option to include the title of the post, the title of the widget, both titles, or neither.

If you want you can add a bunch of widgets, each showing up to five random posts from a different category.


== Installation ==

Installing is pretty easy takes only a minute or two.

1. Upload 'random-one-cat-widget' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

3. On the 'Widgets' sub-menu of 'Appearance' you will find a new widget type called 'Random One Cat'.

4. Add one or more of these to your themes widget display areas.

5. For each widget you add, select a title and category, then decide how you'd like to see the title or custom fields.

6. Save your settings.

7. That's it.  Enjoy!
